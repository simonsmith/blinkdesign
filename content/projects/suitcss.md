SUIT is styling methodology for component-based UI development that was created
by [Nicolas Gallagher](http://nicolasgallagher.com/) and used at Twitter.

I contribute as a core maintainer, triaging issues and working on new
features. Some notable additions include:

* Adding a cross browser tested [Flexbox
  utilty](https://github.com/suitcss/utils-flex)
* Re-factoring the existing [Grid
  component](https://github.com/suitcss/components-grid) to use Flexbox
* Replacing Rework with PostCSS in the [SUIT CSS
  preprocessor](https://github.com/suitcss/preprocessor) and adding
  additional features

BBC Three was moved from a television channel to an online proposition in
February 2016. It's built on Node and renders React components on the client and
server. A few of my responsibilities:

* Architecting a component based UI with
  [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [PostCSS](http://postcss.org/)
  and SUIT CSS.
* Building and maintaining a component library for reuse within the BBC.
* Cross browser testing on a wide variety of devices, including screen
  readers
* Unit testing React components with shallow rendering.
* Optimising script loading with [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) and
  various other performance tweaks.

Led UI development on the re-build of the Radio Times website at BBC
worldwide and later maintained it again whilst at Immediate Media.

Starting over on the new site allowed use of various modern development
practices at the time, such as parts of HTML5 and CSS3. The TV and Radio
listings page was built with a collection of modular MooTools classes to
power the navigation of the grid.

One of the first projects at [Immediate Media](http://www.immediate.co.uk/)
to be have a mobile first responsive design.

I came into the project early on and was tasked with re-factoring the
front-end and setting a good foundation for the site.

Working with another front-end developer, we structured a modular front-end,
broken up into various Sass files that allowed easy re-use of code across
the site. I also structured and wrote a lot of the JS, making use of the
[Primish](https://github.com/DimitarChristoff/primish) library.

Interlopers was started in 2004 out of my frustration at the lack of a
decent community and resource to contribute to. It has grown to become one
of the leading level design communities for Half-Life 2 and other Source
powered games.

I have been responsible for front-end development, content writing,
community management and other general tasks. The site is written in PHP and
is heavily integrated into [phpBB](http://www.phpbb.com/).

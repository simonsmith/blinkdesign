The QMetric site was originally designed and built by an external agency.
However, due to the lack of responsive design and out of date front-end
practices, I rebuilt the site as a side project.

[RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) was used on this project, not only for the
ease of code organisation but also to conditionally load assets based on the
device size such as the Google map on larger devices only. This helped with
performance and usability.

The source of the site [is also viewable on GitHub](https://github.com/qmetric/qmg-website).

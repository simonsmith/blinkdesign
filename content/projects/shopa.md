Shopa was a startup in East London, building an online social marketplace.

I primarily worked on the front-end, including architecting and rebuilding
the site to match a new design. This included:

* Developing modular UI components with [SUIT CSS](http://suitcss.github.io/)
* Structuring the JavaScript with [Flight JS](http://flightjs.github.io/) and
[webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)
* Adding [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) into the Rails pipeline to build SUIT and
Flight components

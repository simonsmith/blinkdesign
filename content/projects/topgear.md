One of my main tasks on the Top Gear site was a complete re-build of the
home page, as well as implementing a new global header and footer onto all
other sections. I worked [with another UI
developer](http://www.alecrust.com/) to completely architect the front-end
code from scratch.

As well as this project I was also responsible for maintaining the Top Gear
WordPress blogs, which largely involved integrating new design features.

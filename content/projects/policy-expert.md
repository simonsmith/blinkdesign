Policy Expert is an insurance product from [QMetric](http://qmetric.co.uk/).

It used a completely new design (sourced externally) developed with a mobile
first responsive approach and used WordPress to power the content.

We chose to use [LESS](http://lesscss.org) and
[RequireJS](http://requirejs.org) as the main technologies and implemented
as much of [the SMACSS approach](http://smacss.com/) as possible.  The site
uses a fluid layout and uses media queries to tweak content positioning at
various screen sizes.

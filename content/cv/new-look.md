Developed an initial version of an iOS app with [React
Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/).

Used [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) to store data from multiple
API endpoints.

Made use of [React Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) and container
components to pass data down the component tree. Keeping them separated this
way greatly assisted unit testing.

Unit tested React components and Redux reducers with
[Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)'s snapshot feature.

Added type checking with [Flow](https://flowtype.org/).

Worked on a mobile-first responsive TV listings grid for Radio Times using
Twitter's [Flight JS library](http://twitter.github.com/flight/),
[Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/),
[Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/) and Sass.

Ran workshops with other members of the UI team on topics such as
[RequireJS](http://requirejs.org), [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) and jQuery
plugin development

Maintained the RadioTimes front-end. Re-factoring old code and developing
new areas of the site.

Identified use of various carousel plugins across multiple sites. To solve
problem this I developed and open-sourced [a jQuery
plugin](https://github.com/simonsmith/jquery.herotabs) that could be used
instead.

Implemented Bootstrap 3 and modular HTML/CSS workflows on a new responsive
website for [You &amp; Your
Wedding](http://www.youandyourwedding.co.uk/venues).

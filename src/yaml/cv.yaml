      description: "Used [VueJS](https://vuejs.org) (via [Nuxt](https://nuxtjs.org)) to build a new
      Simba website that communicates with Shopify via the [Buy SDK](https://shopify.github.io/js-buy-sdk/).

      Built a NodeJS Express API to wrap the Shopify Buy SDK. This also involved
      various non-trivial data transformations to provide sensible payloads for the
      Nuxt application.

      Led knowledge sharing sessions on various topics with junior members of the
      team.

      Carried out a round of performance focused improvements on the existing Shopify
      site. This resulted in a 3 second load time on mobile, down from 30 seconds.

      Assisted with interviewing and general hiring tasks."
